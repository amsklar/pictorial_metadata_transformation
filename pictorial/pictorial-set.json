Parry, a librarian for the U.S. State Department, compiled the maps and several were deaccessioned from the State Department's library. Formats in the collection include single map and maps in books, magazines, calendars, and advertisements. In addition, there are maps on napkins, gift cards, cloth, etc. Included are maps by Ernest Clegg, Richard Edes Harrison, Hal Shelton, Daniel K. Wallingford, MacDonald Gill, Chase Ernest Dudley, among others. Parry created a map that is part of the collection."

          "The document presented here is a pictorial map of Kyo\u0304to published in 1686, early in the Edo period (1603--1867). The publication of maps in Japan started in Kyo\u0304to at the beginning of the Edo period, and the first city map to be published was a map of Kyo\u0304to. The first Kyo\u0304to maps depicted just the urban area, but the scope of the maps gradually expanded to include suburban areas as well. This map depicts the peripheral suburban areas as well as the central urban area. The main feature of the map is the ingenuity with which the information displayed has been maximized while maintaining easy readability. In previous Kyo\u0304to maps the urban areas delimited by roads were painted in black. This was the first map to leave these areas blank, allowing for the inclusion of more information, such as temple names and the names of the owners of houses. As writing all the street names in the map would have required minute handwriting, the streets were marked with a character symbol in a circle and a list of the symbols with their corresponding street names was inserted in blank spaces on the map. The map could also be used as a tourist guidebook. The mountains and rivers outside the city are depicted in color and detailed explanations of famous places, such as Kiyomizudera (Kiyomizu Temple), are included along with pictorial depictions of the buildings. The size of the map would have made it awkward to carry around and the direction of the text varies, allowing it to be read from all sides. These factors suggest that it was intended to be spread out on the floor and viewed from any side."

            "The document presented here is a pictorial map of Kyo\u0304to published in 1686, early in the Edo period (1603--1867). The publication of maps in Japan started in Kyo\u0304to at the beginning of the Edo period, and the first city map to be published was a map of Kyo\u0304to. The first Kyo\u0304to maps depicted just the urban area, but the scope of the maps gradually expanded to include suburban areas as well. This map depicts the peripheral suburban areas as well as the central urban area. The main feature of the map is the ingenuity with which the information displayed has been maximized while maintaining easy readability. In previous Kyo\u0304to maps the urban areas delimited by roads were painted in black. This was the first map to leave these areas blank, allowing for the inclusion of more information, such as temple names and the names of the owners of houses. As writing all the street names in the map would have required minute handwriting, the streets were marked with a character symbol in a circle and a list of the symbols with their corresponding street names was inserted in blank spaces on the map. The map could also be used as a tourist guidebook. The mountains and rivers outside the city are depicted in color and detailed explanations of famous places, such as Kiyomizudera (Kiyomizu Temple), are included along with pictorial depictions of the buildings. The size of the map would have made it awkward to carry around and the direction of the text varies, allowing it to be read from all sides. These factors suggest that it was intended to be spread out on the floor and viewed from any side."

          "This topographical map of Mexico City and its surroundings dates from around 1550, some three decades after the conquest of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitla\u0301n by Herna\u0301n Corte\u0301s in 1521. Tenochtitla\u0301n was founded in the 14th century on an island in the salt lake of Texcoco. Upon occupying the city, the Spanish pulled down its central parts and replaced the Aztec temples with buildings constructed in the Spanish style, but they left the street layout virtually intact. The map shows the new buildings. The cathedral (Iglesia Major) is in the center of the map, next to the square that today is the Plaza de la Constitucio\u0301n. Part of the dedication to Emperor Charles V can be seen in the lower right-hand corner, along with parts of the name Santa Cruz, which is why the royal cosmographer in Seville, Alfonso de Santa Cruz (1505--67), long was thought to have been the cartographer. Later research indicates that the map was painted by a person from Tenochtitla\u0301n/Mexico City, probably an Aztec with European schooling. It is known that Santa Cruz never visited Mexico, and the construction and content of the map suggest that its maker was very familiar with the place and its inhabitants. The symbols on the map (heads, animals, rings, stars, and so forth) represent place-names in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The map contains information about social and working life and animals and plants, thus providing both a geographical description and a rich picture of everyday life in 16th-century Mexico City. The frame consists of ornamental foliage painted in blue on a red background. Roads and canals are marked in brown and light blue. How the map came to Sweden is not known. One theory is that Swedish linguist and traveler Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld purchased it during his stay in Spain in the late 17th century and that it later was donated to the Uppsala University Library."

            "This topographical map of Mexico City and its surroundings dates from around 1550, some three decades after the conquest of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitla\u0301n by Herna\u0301n Corte\u0301s in 1521. Tenochtitla\u0301n was founded in the 14th century on an island in the salt lake of Texcoco. Upon occupying the city, the Spanish pulled down its central parts and replaced the Aztec temples with buildings constructed in the Spanish style, but they left the street layout virtually intact. The map shows the new buildings. The cathedral (Iglesia Major) is in the center of the map, next to the square that today is the Plaza de la Constitucio\u0301n. Part of the dedication to Emperor Charles V can be seen in the lower right-hand corner, along with parts of the name Santa Cruz, which is why the royal cosmographer in Seville, Alfonso de Santa Cruz (1505--67), long was thought to have been the cartographer. Later research indicates that the map was painted by a person from Tenochtitla\u0301n/Mexico City, probably an Aztec with European schooling. It is known that Santa Cruz never visited Mexico, and the construction and content of the map suggest that its maker was very familiar with the place and its inhabitants. The symbols on the map (heads, animals, rings, stars, and so forth) represent place-names in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The map contains information about social and working life and animals and plants, thus providing both a geographical description and a rich picture of everyday life in 16th-century Mexico City. The frame consists of ornamental foliage painted in blue on a red background. Roads and canals are marked in brown and light blue. How the map came to Sweden is not known. One theory is that Swedish linguist and traveler Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld purchased it during his stay in Spain in the late 17th century and that it later was donated to the Uppsala University Library."

          "Presented here is a pictorial route map, published in 1672 (early Edo period), that depicts the journey from Edo (present-day Tokyo) to Nagasaki. The first volume shows the land route from Edo to Kyo\u0304to. Starting from Edo Castle, it proceeds to Kyo\u0304to along the To\u0304kaido\u0304, which was the main road in the Edo period. It depicts stations on the route, natural scenery, and famous places, such as Mount Fuji (in the 11th scene), accompanied by explanatory text. The second volume shows the route from Osaka to Nagasaki. It depicts mainly sea routes, although some land route scenes also appear after Kyu\u0304shu\u0304. Seto Naikai (The Inland Sea) stretches out in the middle of the pictures, and towns and scenic spots along the Honshu\u0304 and Shikoku coasts are also depicted. This volume does not feature the sort of explanatory text that was provided in the first volume, but it does display the distances of the sea routes. It is thought that the contents and drawing techniques are based on another pictorial route map, compiled by the Shogunate and completed in 1668."

            "Presented here is a pictorial route map, published in 1672 (early Edo period), that depicts the journey from Edo (present-day Tokyo) to Nagasaki. The first volume shows the land route from Edo to Kyo\u0304to. Starting from Edo Castle, it proceeds to Kyo\u0304to along the To\u0304kaido\u0304, which was the main road in the Edo period. It depicts stations on the route, natural scenery, and famous places, such as Mount Fuji (in the 11th scene), accompanied by explanatory text. The second volume shows the route from Osaka to Nagasaki. It depicts mainly sea routes, although some land route scenes also appear after Kyu\u0304shu\u0304. Seto Naikai (The Inland Sea) stretches out in the middle of the pictures, and towns and scenic spots along the Honshu\u0304 and Shikoku coasts are also depicted. This volume does not feature the sort of explanatory text that was provided in the first volume, but it does display the distances of the sea routes. It is thought that the contents and drawing techniques are based on another pictorial route map, compiled by the Shogunate and completed in 1668."

Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting.

          "A encrenca europe\u0301a mappa conflagrado (A troubled Europe: Map of the conflagration) is a satirical map of Europe, published shortly after the outbreak of World War I. The map is dated August 22, 1914, and signed by Raul Paranhos Pederneiras (1874-1953), a Brazilian illustrator, painter, caricaturist, author, and professor at the School of Fine Arts in the University of Rio de Janeiro. The countries of Europe are personified as male and female characters, most with angry faces and making threatening gestures toward their neighbors. The map was sponsored by Globo, a financial institution that offered loans, savings accounts, and insurance. The map reflects the keen interest with which people in Brazil, as in other countries, followed developments in Europe as the continent descended into war. Brazil was the only country in South America to declare war on Germany and the only country in Latin America to participate militarily in World War I. Like the United States, Brazil originally maintained strict neutrality in the conflict between the Allied and Central powers. However, in October 1917, following attacks by German submarines on Brazilian merchant ships, Brazil entered the war on the side of the Allies. The Brazilian army did not send troops to Europe, but the Brazilian navy helped to patrol the South Atlantic for German submarines. Brazil was also an important supplier of commodities to the Allies during the war."

The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated November 1, 1580, has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs."

The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated November 1, 1580, has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs."

          "This special map collection was culminated by map librarian Ethel M. Fair (1884-1979). It consists of pictorial maps produced in several formats, and ranges in period from the 1840s to the 1960s. Some are cartoon maps, while others are cartographs. Unusual formats include maps on place mats, napkins, table cloths, and handkerchiefs. The collection contains mostly tourist maps, road maps, educational maps, and commercial maps. The majority of the maps depict North America, but other areas are represented. There are early facsimiles and some maps that are undated, but most of these appear to have been produced between 1920s and 1950s. A number of the maps were created by female cartographers, who were of special interest to Fair."

While many of the pieces were created as governmental propaganda, others appeared in commercial publications, including the Star Weekly, Fortune Magazine, the Daily Mail, and the Los Angeles Examiner. Some of the maps were created by famous cartographers, such as Ernest Clegg, Fred W. Rose, Arthur Kampf, Ezra C. Stiles, Richard Edes Harrison, Ernest Dudley Chase, and F.E. Manning. Many of the collection items are described in the book titled War map: pictorial conflict maps 1900-1950 by Philip Curtis and Jakob Sondergard Pedersen, which was published in 2016. A proof of the book is part of the collection."

          "This map from Culhuaca\u0301n in the present-day Delegacio\u0301n de Ixtapalapa, Mexico City, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated January 17, 1580, has glosses in Spanish."

            "This map from Culhuaca\u0301n in the present-day Delegacio\u0301n de Ixtapalapa, Mexico City, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated January 17, 1580, has glosses in Spanish."

Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map dates from 1581 and has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, and in Spanish."

Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated March 7, 1582, has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, Spanish, and native pictorial language."

The map can be seen as a condemnation of the powers of Europe, engaged as they were at that time in plunging the continent of Europe into the great conflagration that became World War I. Each of 21 countries is represented as an animal, with the names of the countries identified by a key in the upper-left corner of the map. The major powers all are depicted as large and ferocious beasts. Russia, a polar bear, claws at the wolf of Austria-Hungary, drawing blood, and at the German tiger, which is devouring the stag of Belgium. Great Britain, a leopard, and France, a lion, both are trying to engage the tiger. Serbia appears to be a rat, gnawing of the ear of the Austro-Hungarian wolf. Ottoman Turkey is portrayed as a particularly unattractive crocodile, while the smaller countries, many of them neutral, are represented by smaller and more pacific animals, such as the Albanian rabbit and the Greek turtle. Maps showing countries as animals had a long history in Europe, going back at least to the 16th and 17th centuries, when the Low Countries frequently were drawn in the form of a lion."

Parry, a librarian for the U.S. State Department, compiled the maps and several were deaccessioned from the State Department's library. Formats in the collection include single map and maps in books, magazines, calendars, and advertisements. In addition, there are maps on napkins, gift cards, cloth, etc. Included are maps by Ernest Clegg, Richard Edes Harrison, Hal Shelton, Daniel K. Wallingford, MacDonald Gill, Chase Ernest Dudley, among others. Parry created a map that is part of the collection."

                "The document presented here is a pictorial map of Kyo\u0304to published in 1686, early in the Edo period (1603--1867). The publication of maps in Japan started in Kyo\u0304to at the beginning of the Edo period, and the first city map to be published was a map of Kyo\u0304to. The first Kyo\u0304to maps depicted just the urban area, but the scope of the maps gradually expanded to include suburban areas as well. This map depicts the peripheral suburban areas as well as the central urban area. The main feature of the map is the ingenuity with which the information displayed has been maximized while maintaining easy readability. In previous Kyo\u0304to maps the urban areas delimited by roads were painted in black. This was the first map to leave these areas blank, allowing for the inclusion of more information, such as temple names and the names of the owners of houses. As writing all the street names in the map would have required minute handwriting, the streets were marked with a character symbol in a circle and a list of the symbols with their corresponding street names was inserted in blank spaces on the map. The map could also be used as a tourist guidebook. The mountains and rivers outside the city are depicted in color and detailed explanations of famous places, such as Kiyomizudera (Kiyomizu Temple), are included along with pictorial depictions of the buildings. The size of the map would have made it awkward to carry around and the direction of the text varies, allowing it to be read from all sides. These factors suggest that it was intended to be spread out on the floor and viewed from any side."

                "This topographical map of Mexico City and its surroundings dates from around 1550, some three decades after the conquest of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitla\u0301n by Herna\u0301n Corte\u0301s in 1521. Tenochtitla\u0301n was founded in the 14th century on an island in the salt lake of Texcoco. Upon occupying the city, the Spanish pulled down its central parts and replaced the Aztec temples with buildings constructed in the Spanish style, but they left the street layout virtually intact. The map shows the new buildings. The cathedral (Iglesia Major) is in the center of the map, next to the square that today is the Plaza de la Constitucio\u0301n. Part of the dedication to Emperor Charles V can be seen in the lower right-hand corner, along with parts of the name Santa Cruz, which is why the royal cosmographer in Seville, Alfonso de Santa Cruz (1505--67), long was thought to have been the cartographer. Later research indicates that the map was painted by a person from Tenochtitla\u0301n/Mexico City, probably an Aztec with European schooling. It is known that Santa Cruz never visited Mexico, and the construction and content of the map suggest that its maker was very familiar with the place and its inhabitants. The symbols on the map (heads, animals, rings, stars, and so forth) represent place-names in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The map contains information about social and working life and animals and plants, thus providing both a geographical description and a rich picture of everyday life in 16th-century Mexico City. The frame consists of ornamental foliage painted in blue on a red background. Roads and canals are marked in brown and light blue. How the map came to Sweden is not known. One theory is that Swedish linguist and traveler Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld purchased it during his stay in Spain in the late 17th century and that it later was donated to the Uppsala University Library."

                "Presented here is a pictorial route map, published in 1672 (early Edo period), that depicts the journey from Edo (present-day Tokyo) to Nagasaki. The first volume shows the land route from Edo to Kyo\u0304to. Starting from Edo Castle, it proceeds to Kyo\u0304to along the To\u0304kaido\u0304, which was the main road in the Edo period. It depicts stations on the route, natural scenery, and famous places, such as Mount Fuji (in the 11th scene), accompanied by explanatory text. The second volume shows the route from Osaka to Nagasaki. It depicts mainly sea routes, although some land route scenes also appear after Kyu\u0304shu\u0304. Seto Naikai (The Inland Sea) stretches out in the middle of the pictures, and towns and scenic spots along the Honshu\u0304 and Shikoku coasts are also depicted. This volume does not feature the sort of explanatory text that was provided in the first volume, but it does display the distances of the sea routes. It is thought that the contents and drawing techniques are based on another pictorial route map, compiled by the Shogunate and completed in 1668."

                "This map from Ixcatla\u0301n, Santa Mari\u0301a, in the present-day state of Oaxaca, Mexico, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated October 13, 1579, has glosses in Spanish."

                  "This map from Ixcatla\u0301n, Santa Mari\u0301a, in the present-day state of Oaxaca, Mexico, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated October 13, 1579, has glosses in Spanish."

                "A encrenca europe\u0301a mappa conflagrado (A troubled Europe: Map of the conflagration) is a satirical map of Europe, published shortly after the outbreak of World War I. The map is dated August 22, 1914, and signed by Raul Paranhos Pederneiras (1874-1953), a Brazilian illustrator, painter, caricaturist, author, and professor at the School of Fine Arts in the University of Rio de Janeiro. The countries of Europe are personified as male and female characters, most with angry faces and making threatening gestures toward their neighbors. The map was sponsored by Globo, a financial institution that offered loans, savings accounts, and insurance. The map reflects the keen interest with which people in Brazil, as in other countries, followed developments in Europe as the continent descended into war. Brazil was the only country in South America to declare war on Germany and the only country in Latin America to participate militarily in World War I. Like the United States, Brazil originally maintained strict neutrality in the conflict between the Allied and Central powers. However, in October 1917, following attacks by German submarines on Brazilian merchant ships, Brazil entered the war on the side of the Allies. The Brazilian army did not send troops to Europe, but the Brazilian navy helped to patrol the South Atlantic for German submarines. Brazil was also an important supplier of commodities to the Allies during the war."

                "This map from Zempoala in the present-day state of Veracruz, Mexico, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated November 1, 1580, has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs."

                "This special map collection was culminated by map librarian Ethel M. Fair (1884-1979). It consists of pictorial maps produced in several formats, and ranges in period from the 1840s to the 1960s. Some are cartoon maps, while others are cartographs. Unusual formats include maps on place mats, napkins, table cloths, and handkerchiefs. The collection contains mostly tourist maps, road maps, educational maps, and commercial maps. The majority of the maps depict North America, but other areas are represented. There are early facsimiles and some maps that are undated, but most of these appear to have been produced between 1920s and 1950s. A number of the maps were created by female cartographers, who were of special interest to Fair."

                "A collection of 180 pictorial and propaganda maps that illustrate events related to World War I, the interwar years, World War II, the formation of the United Nations, and the Cold War. While many of the pieces were created as governmental propaganda, others appeared in commercial publications, including the Star Weekly, Fortune Magazine, the Daily Mail, and the Los Angeles Examiner. Some of the maps were created by famous cartographers, such as Ernest Clegg, Fred W. Rose, Arthur Kampf, Ezra C. Stiles, Richard Edes Harrison, Ernest Dudley Chase, and F.E. Manning. Many of the collection items are described in the book titled War map: pictorial conflict maps 1900-1950 by Philip Curtis and Jakob Sondergard Pedersen, which was published in 2016. A proof of the book is part of the collection."

                "This map from Culhuaca\u0301n in the present-day Delegacio\u0301n de Ixtapalapa, Mexico City, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated January 17, 1580, has glosses in Spanish."

                  "This map from Culhuaca\u0301n in the present-day Delegacio\u0301n de Ixtapalapa, Mexico City, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated January 17, 1580, has glosses in Spanish."

Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map dates from 1581 and has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, and in Spanish."

These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map dates from 1581 and has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, and in Spanish."

                "This map from Zumpango del Ri\u0301o in the present-day state of Guerrero, Mexico, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated March 7, 1582, has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, Spanish, and native pictorial language."

The map can be seen as a condemnation of the powers of Europe, engaged as they were at that time in plunging the continent of Europe into the great conflagration that became World War I. Each of 21 countries is represented as an animal, with the names of the countries identified by a key in the upper-left corner of the map. The major powers all are depicted as large and ferocious beasts. Russia, a polar bear, claws at the wolf of Austria-Hungary, drawing blood, and at the German tiger, which is devouring the stag of Belgium. Great Britain, a leopard, and France, a lion, both are trying to engage the tiger. Serbia appears to be a rat, gnawing of the ear of the Austro-Hungarian wolf. Ottoman Turkey is portrayed as a particularly unattractive crocodile, while the smaller countries, many of them neutral, are represented by smaller and more pacific animals, such as the Albanian rabbit and the Greek turtle. Maps showing countries as animals had a long history in Europe, going back at least to the 16th and 17th centuries, when the Low Countries frequently were drawn in the form of a lion."

Accompanied by folded newspaper: Manhattan published weekly and copyrighted 1933 by Dell Publishing Company, Inc. ... Volume 1, Number 1, January 18, 1933, 16 pages.

        "The collection consists of some 871 maps that are largely pictorial. Muriel H. Parry, a librarian for the U.S. State Department, compiled the maps and several were deaccessioned from the State Department's library. Formats in the collection include single map and maps in books, magazines, calendars, and advertisements. In addition, there are maps on napkins, gift cards, cloth, etc. Included are maps by Ernest Clegg, Richard Edes Harrison, Hal Shelton, Daniel K. Wallingford, MacDonald Gill, Chase Ernest Dudley, among others. Parry created a map that is part of the collection."

        "The document presented here is a pictorial map of Kyo\u0304to published in 1686, early in the Edo period (1603--1867). The publication of maps in Japan started in Kyo\u0304to at the beginning of the Edo period, and the first city map to be published was a map of Kyo\u0304to. The first Kyo\u0304to maps depicted just the urban area, but the scope of the maps gradually expanded to include suburban areas as well. This map depicts the peripheral suburban areas as well as the central urban area. The main feature of the map is the ingenuity with which the information displayed has been maximized while maintaining easy readability. In previous Kyo\u0304to maps the urban areas delimited by roads were painted in black. This was the first map to leave these areas blank, allowing for the inclusion of more information, such as temple names and the names of the owners of houses. As writing all the street names in the map would have required minute handwriting, the streets were marked with a character symbol in a circle and a list of the symbols with their corresponding street names was inserted in blank spaces on the map. The map could also be used as a tourist guidebook. The mountains and rivers outside the city are depicted in color and detailed explanations of famous places, such as Kiyomizudera (Kiyomizu Temple), are included along with pictorial depictions of the buildings. The size of the map would have made it awkward to carry around and the direction of the text varies, allowing it to be read from all sides. These factors suggest that it was intended to be spread out on the floor and viewed from any side."

        "This topographical map of Mexico City and its surroundings dates from around 1550, some three decades after the conquest of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitla\u0301n by Herna\u0301n Corte\u0301s in 1521. Tenochtitla\u0301n was founded in the 14th century on an island in the salt lake of Texcoco. Upon occupying the city, the Spanish pulled down its central parts and replaced the Aztec temples with buildings constructed in the Spanish style, but they left the street layout virtually intact. The map shows the new buildings. The cathedral (Iglesia Major) is in the center of the map, next to the square that today is the Plaza de la Constitucio\u0301n. Part of the dedication to Emperor Charles V can be seen in the lower right-hand corner, along with parts of the name Santa Cruz, which is why the royal cosmographer in Seville, Alfonso de Santa Cruz (1505--67), long was thought to have been the cartographer. Later research indicates that the map was painted by a person from Tenochtitla\u0301n/Mexico City, probably an Aztec with European schooling. It is known that Santa Cruz never visited Mexico, and the construction and content of the map suggest that its maker was very familiar with the place and its inhabitants. The symbols on the map (heads, animals, rings, stars, and so forth) represent place-names in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The map contains information about social and working life and animals and plants, thus providing both a geographical description and a rich picture of everyday life in 16th-century Mexico City. The frame consists of ornamental foliage painted in blue on a red background. Roads and canals are marked in brown and light blue. How the map came to Sweden is not known. One theory is that Swedish linguist and traveler Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld purchased it during his stay in Spain in the late 17th century and that it later was donated to the Uppsala University Library."

          "This topographical map of Mexico City and its surroundings dates from around 1550, some three decades after the conquest of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitla\u0301n by Herna\u0301n Corte\u0301s in 1521. Tenochtitla\u0301n was founded in the 14th century on an island in the salt lake of Texcoco. Upon occupying the city, the Spanish pulled down its central parts and replaced the Aztec temples with buildings constructed in the Spanish style, but they left the street layout virtually intact. The map shows the new buildings. The cathedral (Iglesia Major) is in the center of the map, next to the square that today is the Plaza de la Constitucio\u0301n. Part of the dedication to Emperor Charles V can be seen in the lower right-hand corner, along with parts of the name Santa Cruz, which is why the royal cosmographer in Seville, Alfonso de Santa Cruz (1505--67), long was thought to have been the cartographer. Later research indicates that the map was painted by a person from Tenochtitla\u0301n/Mexico City, probably an Aztec with European schooling. It is known that Santa Cruz never visited Mexico, and the construction and content of the map suggest that its maker was very familiar with the place and its inhabitants. The symbols on the map (heads, animals, rings, stars, and so forth) represent place-names in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The map contains information about social and working life and animals and plants, thus providing both a geographical description and a rich picture of everyday life in 16th-century Mexico City. The frame consists of ornamental foliage painted in blue on a red background. Roads and canals are marked in brown and light blue. How the map came to Sweden is not known. One theory is that Swedish linguist and traveler Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld purchased it during his stay in Spain in the late 17th century and that it later was donated to the Uppsala University Library."

It depicts stations on the route, natural scenery, and famous places, such as Mount Fuji (in the 11th scene), accompanied by explanatory text. The second volume shows the route from Osaka to Nagasaki. It depicts mainly sea routes, although some land route scenes also appear after Kyu\u0304shu\u0304. Seto Naikai (The Inland Sea) stretches out in the middle of the pictures, and towns and scenic spots along the Honshu\u0304 and Shikoku coasts are also depicted. This volume does not feature the sort of explanatory text that was provided in the first volume, but it does display the distances of the sea routes. It is thought that the contents and drawing techniques are based on another pictorial route map, compiled by the Shogunate and completed in 1668."

The second volume shows the route from Osaka to Nagasaki. It depicts mainly sea routes, although some land route scenes also appear after Kyu\u0304shu\u0304. Seto Naikai (The Inland Sea) stretches out in the middle of the pictures, and towns and scenic spots along the Honshu\u0304 and Shikoku coasts are also depicted. This volume does not feature the sort of explanatory text that was provided in the first volume, but it does display the distances of the sea routes. It is thought that the contents and drawing techniques are based on another pictorial route map, compiled by the Shogunate and completed in 1668."

Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting.

        "A encrenca europe\u0301a mappa conflagrado (A troubled Europe: Map of the conflagration) is a satirical map of Europe, published shortly after the outbreak of World War I. The map is dated August 22, 1914, and signed by Raul Paranhos Pederneiras (1874-1953), a Brazilian illustrator, painter, caricaturist, author, and professor at the School of Fine Arts in the University of Rio de Janeiro. The countries of Europe are personified as male and female characters, most with angry faces and making threatening gestures toward their neighbors. The map was sponsored by Globo, a financial institution that offered loans, savings accounts, and insurance. The map reflects the keen interest with which people in Brazil, as in other countries, followed developments in Europe as the continent descended into war. Brazil was the only country in South America to declare war on Germany and the only country in Latin America to participate militarily in World War I. Like the United States, Brazil originally maintained strict neutrality in the conflict between the Allied and Central powers. However, in October 1917, following attacks by German submarines on Brazilian merchant ships, Brazil entered the war on the side of the Allies. The Brazilian army did not send troops to Europe, but the Brazilian navy helped to patrol the South Atlantic for German submarines. Brazil was also an important supplier of commodities to the Allies during the war."

The countries of Europe are personified as male and female characters, most with angry faces and making threatening gestures toward their neighbors. The map was sponsored by Globo, a financial institution that offered loans, savings accounts, and insurance. The map reflects the keen interest with which people in Brazil, as in other countries, followed developments in Europe as the continent descended into war. Brazil was the only country in South America to declare war on Germany and the only country in Latin America to participate militarily in World War I. Like the United States, Brazil originally maintained strict neutrality in the conflict between the Allied and Central powers. However, in October 1917, following attacks by German submarines on Brazilian merchant ships, Brazil entered the war on the side of the Allies. The Brazilian army did not send troops to Europe, but the Brazilian navy helped to patrol the South Atlantic for German submarines. Brazil was also an important supplier of commodities to the Allies during the war."

        "This map from Zempoala in the present-day state of Veracruz, Mexico, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated November 1, 1580, has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs."

          "This map from Zempoala in the present-day state of Veracruz, Mexico, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated November 1, 1580, has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs."

        "This special map collection was culminated by map librarian Ethel M. Fair (1884-1979). It consists of pictorial maps produced in several formats, and ranges in period from the 1840s to the 1960s. Some are cartoon maps, while others are cartographs. Unusual formats include maps on place mats, napkins, table cloths, and handkerchiefs. The collection contains mostly tourist maps, road maps, educational maps, and commercial maps. The majority of the maps depict North America, but other areas are represented. There are early facsimiles and some maps that are undated, but most of these appear to have been produced between 1920s and 1950s. A number of the maps were created by female cartographers, who were of special interest to Fair."

        "A collection of 180 pictorial and propaganda maps that illustrate events related to World War I, the interwar years, World War II, the formation of the United Nations, and the Cold War. While many of the pieces were created as governmental propaganda, others appeared in commercial publications, including the Star Weekly, Fortune Magazine, the Daily Mail, and the Los Angeles Examiner. Some of the maps were created by famous cartographers, such as Ernest Clegg, Fred W. Rose, Arthur Kampf, Ezra C. Stiles, Richard Edes Harrison, Ernest Dudley Chase, and F.E. Manning. Many of the collection items are described in the book titled War map: pictorial conflict maps 1900-1950 by Philip Curtis and Jakob Sondergard Pedersen, which was published in 2016. A proof of the book is part of the collection."

Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures.

        "This map from Cholula in the present-day state of Puebla, Mexico, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map dates from 1581 and has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, and in Spanish."

Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map dates from 1581 and has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, and in Spanish."

        "This map from Zumpango del Ri\u0301o in the present-day state of Guerrero, Mexico, is from the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas collection in the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin. Dating from between 1578 and 1586, the Relaciones Geogra\u0301ficas are responses to a questionnaire initiated by the Spanish crown in 1577, requesting information about Spanish-held territories in the Americas. The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures. These both convey information about such topics as the colonial economy and the spread of European religion in New Spain and are artifacts for the study of the history of Latin American art and manuscript painting. This map, dated March 7, 1582, has glosses in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, Spanish, and native pictorial language."

        "Mappa Humori\u0301stico da Europa (Humorous map of Europe) was produced in 1914 by the well-known Portuguese modernist painter and illustrator Anto\u0301nio Soares (1894-1978). The map can be seen as a condemnation of the powers of Europe, engaged as they were at that time in plunging the continent of Europe into the great conflagration that became World War I. Each of 21 countries is represented as an animal, with the names of the countries identified by a key in the upper-left corner of the map. The major powers all are depicted as large and ferocious beasts. Russia, a polar bear, claws at the wolf of Austria-Hungary, drawing blood, and at the German tiger, which is devouring the stag of Belgium. Great Britain, a leopard, and France, a lion, both are trying to engage the tiger. Serbia appears to be a rat, gnawing of the ear of the Austro-Hungarian wolf. Ottoman Turkey is portrayed as a particularly unattractive crocodile, while the smaller countries, many of them neutral, are represented by smaller and more pacific animals, such as the Albanian rabbit and the Greek turtle. Maps showing countries as animals had a long history in Europe, going back at least to the 16th and 17th centuries, when the Low Countries frequently were drawn in the form of a lion."
