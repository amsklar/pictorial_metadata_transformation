          "This map is one of four manuscript charts from the first great voyage of exploration by Captain James Cook, which in April 1770 made the first clear delineation of the east coast of Australia. Sponsored by the Royal Society and the Royal Navy, the expedition had several objectives. Cook was to observe and describe the transit of Venus, chart the coastlines of places he visited in the South Pacific, and record details of the peoples, flora, and fauna he saw. The expedition sponsors also hoped Cook would find and claim for Britain the land then known as terra incognita australis. Cook did not sail close to shore, except in a few places, so the amount of detail shown in the map varied with his ship's distance from the coast."

Sponsored by the Royal Society and the Royal Navy, the expedition had several objectives. Cook was to observe and describe the transit of Venus, chart the coastlines of places he visited in the South Pacific, and record details of the peoples, flora, and fauna he saw. The expedition sponsors also hoped Cook would find and claim for Britain the land then known as terra incognita australis. Cook did not sail close to shore, except in a few places, so the amount of detail shown in the map varied with his ship's distance from the coast."

          "Presented here is a pocket atlas from 1900 of the steam transportation network of Siberia, including the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Ussuri Railroad, and the Amur River steamship lines. The publication reflects Russian national pride in the recent establishment of transit links to the Pacific Ocean, even before all sections of the Trans-Siberian Railroad were complete. The atlas contains 27 maps and 14 photographs. The first map shows the global network of rail and steamship connections. It is followed by a general map of Asiatic Russia (Siberia) and a map of the Trans-Siberian Railroad as far as Irkutsk (the route to Vladivostok was unfinished as of 1900, especially the arduous mountain route along the southern tip of Lake Baikal). Other maps show the southern shores of Lake Baikal; the Trans-Baikal Railroad; the Amur steamship routes and the Ussuri Railroad; the Kwantung region (the southern part of Liaodong Peninsula in China, a territorial concession occupied by Russia in 1898); with Dalian and Port Arthur and their environs. Separate maps show some of the largest Siberian and Russian Far Eastern cities and their environs, including Tomsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Chita, Blagoveshchensk, and Vladivostok. Interspersed with the maps are photographs of Siberian scenes, depicting railroad stations, steamship wharves, and vistas of places shown on the accompanying maps. World Digital Library."

The atlas contains 27 maps and 14 photographs. The first map shows the global network of rail and steamship connections. It is followed by a general map of Asiatic Russia (Siberia) and a map of the Trans-Siberian Railroad as far as Irkutsk (the route to Vladivostok was unfinished as of 1900, especially the arduous mountain route along the southern tip of Lake Baikal). Other maps show the southern shores of Lake Baikal; the Trans-Baikal Railroad; the Amur steamship routes and the Ussuri Railroad; the Kwantung region (the southern part of Liaodong Peninsula in China, a territorial concession occupied by Russia in 1898); with Dalian and Port Arthur and their environs. Separate maps show some of the largest Siberian and Russian Far Eastern cities and their environs, including Tomsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Chita, Blagoveshchensk, and Vladivostok. Interspersed with the maps are photographs of Siberian scenes, depicting railroad stations, steamship wharves, and vistas of places shown on the accompanying maps. World Digital Library."

The expedition sponsors also hoped Cook would find and claim for Britain the land then known as terra incognita australis. Cook did not sail close to shore, except in a few places, so the amount of detail shown in the map varied with his ship's distance from the coast."

Cook was to observe and describe the transit of Venus, chart the coastlines of places he visited in the South Pacific, and record details of the peoples, flora, and fauna he saw. The expedition sponsors also hoped Cook would find and claim for Britain the land then known as terra incognita australis. Cook did not sail close to shore, except in a few places, so the amount of detail shown in the map varied with his ship's distance from the coast."

                  "This map is one of four manuscript charts from the first great voyage of exploration by Captain James Cook, which in April 1770 made the first clear delineation of the east coast of Australia. Sponsored by the Royal Society and the Royal Navy, the expedition had several objectives. Cook was to observe and describe the transit of Venus, chart the coastlines of places he visited in the South Pacific, and record details of the peoples, flora, and fauna he saw. The expedition sponsors also hoped Cook would find and claim for Britain the land then known as terra incognita australis. Cook did not sail close to shore, except in a few places, so the amount of detail shown in the map varied with his ship's distance from the coast."

                "Presented here is a pocket atlas from 1900 of the steam transportation network of Siberia, including the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Ussuri Railroad, and the Amur River steamship lines. The publication reflects Russian national pride in the recent establishment of transit links to the Pacific Ocean, even before all sections of the Trans-Siberian Railroad were complete. The atlas contains 27 maps and 14 photographs. The first map shows the global network of rail and steamship connections. It is followed by a general map of Asiatic Russia (Siberia) and a map of the Trans-Siberian Railroad as far as Irkutsk (the route to Vladivostok was unfinished as of 1900, especially the arduous mountain route along the southern tip of Lake Baikal). Other maps show the southern shores of Lake Baikal; the Trans-Baikal Railroad; the Amur steamship routes and the Ussuri Railroad; the Kwantung region (the southern part of Liaodong Peninsula in China, a territorial concession occupied by Russia in 1898); with Dalian and Port Arthur and their environs. Separate maps show some of the largest Siberian and Russian Far Eastern cities and their environs, including Tomsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Chita, Blagoveshchensk, and Vladivostok. Interspersed with the maps are photographs of Siberian scenes, depicting railroad stations, steamship wharves, and vistas of places shown on the accompanying maps. World Digital Library."

                  "Presented here is a pocket atlas from 1900 of the steam transportation network of Siberia, including the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Ussuri Railroad, and the Amur River steamship lines. The publication reflects Russian national pride in the recent establishment of transit links to the Pacific Ocean, even before all sections of the Trans-Siberian Railroad were complete. The atlas contains 27 maps and 14 photographs. The first map shows the global network of rail and steamship connections. It is followed by a general map of Asiatic Russia (Siberia) and a map of the Trans-Siberian Railroad as far as Irkutsk (the route to Vladivostok was unfinished as of 1900, especially the arduous mountain route along the southern tip of Lake Baikal). Other maps show the southern shores of Lake Baikal; the Trans-Baikal Railroad; the Amur steamship routes and the Ussuri Railroad; the Kwantung region (the southern part of Liaodong Peninsula in China, a territorial concession occupied by Russia in 1898); with Dalian and Port Arthur and their environs. Separate maps show some of the largest Siberian and Russian Far Eastern cities and their environs, including Tomsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Chita, Blagoveshchensk, and Vladivostok. Interspersed with the maps are photographs of Siberian scenes, depicting railroad stations, steamship wharves, and vistas of places shown on the accompanying maps. World Digital Library."

Cook was to observe and describe the transit of Venus, chart the coastlines of places he visited in the South Pacific, and record details of the peoples, flora, and fauna he saw. The expedition sponsors also hoped Cook would find and claim for Britain the land then known as terra incognita australis. Cook did not sail close to shore, except in a few places, so the amount of detail shown in the map varied with his ship's distance from the coast."

        "This map is one of four manuscript charts from the first great voyage of exploration by Captain James Cook, which in April 1770 made the first clear delineation of the east coast of Australia. Sponsored by the Royal Society and the Royal Navy, the expedition had several objectives. Cook was to observe and describe the transit of Venus, chart the coastlines of places he visited in the South Pacific, and record details of the peoples, flora, and fauna he saw. The expedition sponsors also hoped Cook would find and claim for Britain the land then known as terra incognita australis. Cook did not sail close to shore, except in a few places, so the amount of detail shown in the map varied with his ship's distance from the coast."

        "Presented here is a pocket atlas from 1900 of the steam transportation network of Siberia, including the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Ussuri Railroad, and the Amur River steamship lines. The publication reflects Russian national pride in the recent establishment of transit links to the Pacific Ocean, even before all sections of the Trans-Siberian Railroad were complete. The atlas contains 27 maps and 14 photographs. The first map shows the global network of rail and steamship connections. It is followed by a general map of Asiatic Russia (Siberia) and a map of the Trans-Siberian Railroad as far as Irkutsk (the route to Vladivostok was unfinished as of 1900, especially the arduous mountain route along the southern tip of Lake Baikal). Other maps show the southern shores of Lake Baikal; the Trans-Baikal Railroad; the Amur steamship routes and the Ussuri Railroad; the Kwantung region (the southern part of Liaodong Peninsula in China, a territorial concession occupied by Russia in 1898); with Dalian and Port Arthur and their environs. Separate maps show some of the largest Siberian and Russian Far Eastern cities and their environs, including Tomsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Chita, Blagoveshchensk, and Vladivostok. Interspersed with the maps are photographs of Siberian scenes, depicting railroad stations, steamship wharves, and vistas of places shown on the accompanying maps. World Digital Library."
