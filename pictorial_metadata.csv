Tenochtitlán was founded in the 14th century on an island in the salt lake of Texcoco. Upon occupying the city, the Spanish pulled down its central parts and replaced the Aztec temples with buildings constructed in the Spanish style, but they left the street layout virtually intact. The map shows the new buildings. The cathedral (Iglesia Major) is in the center of the map, next to the square that today is the Plaza de la Constitución. Part of the dedication to Emperor Charles V can be seen in the lower right-hand corner, along with parts of the name Santa Cruz, which is why the royal cosmographer in Seville, Alfonso de Santa Cruz (1505--67), long was thought to have been the cartographer. Later research indicates that the map was painted by a person from Tenochtitlán/Mexico City, probably an Aztec with European schooling. It is known that Santa Cruz never visited Mexico, and the construction and content of the map suggest that its maker was very familiar with the place and its inhabitants. The symbols on the map (heads, animals, rings, stars, and so forth) represent place-names in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The map contains information about social and working life and animals and plants, thus providing both a geographical description and a rich picture of everyday life in 16th-century Mexico City. The frame consists of ornamental foliage painted in blue on a red background. Roads and canals are marked in brown and light blue. How the map came to Sweden is not known. One theory is that Swedish linguist and traveler Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld purchased it during his stay in Spain in the late 17th century and that it later was donated to the Uppsala University Library.']",,,

Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures.

The first volume shows the land route from Edo to Kyōto. Starting from Edo Castle, it proceeds to Kyōto along the Tōkaidō, which was the main road in the Edo period. It depicts stations on the route, natural scenery, and famous places, such as Mount Fuji (in the 11th scene), accompanied by explanatory text. The second volume shows the route from Osaka to Nagasaki. It depicts mainly sea routes, although some land route scenes also appear after Kyūshū. Seto Naikai (The Inland Sea) stretches out in the middle of the pictures, and towns and scenic spots along the Honshū and Shikoku coasts are also depicted. This volume does not feature the sort of explanatory text that was provided in the first volume, but it does display the distances of the sea routes.

The countries of Europe are personified as male and female characters, most with angry faces and making threatening gestures toward their neighbors. The map was sponsored by Globo, a financial institution that offered loans, savings accounts, and insurance. The map reflects the keen interest with which people in Brazil, as in other countries, followed developments in Europe as the continent descended into war. Brazil was the only country in South America to declare war on Germany and the only country in Latin America to participate militarily in World War I. Like the United States, Brazil originally maintained strict neutrality in the conflict between the Allied and Central powers. However, in October 1917, following attacks by German submarines on Brazilian merchant ships, Brazil entered the war on the side of the Allies. The Brazilian army did not send troops to Europe, but the Brazilian navy helped to patrol the South Atlantic for German submarines. Brazil was also an important supplier of commodities to the Allies during the war.']",,,

The publication of maps in Japan started in Kyōto at the beginning of the Edo period, and the first city map to be published was a map of Kyōto. The first Kyōto maps depicted just the urban area, but the scope of the maps gradually expanded to include suburban areas as well. This map depicts the peripheral suburban areas as well as the central urban area. The main feature of the map is the ingenuity with which the information displayed has been maximized while maintaining easy readability. In previous Kyōto maps the urban areas delimited by roads were painted in black. This was the first map to leave these areas blank, allowing for the inclusion of more information, such as temple names and the names of the owners of houses. As writing all the street names in the map would have required minute handwriting, the streets were marked with a character symbol in a circle and a list of the symbols with their corresponding street names was inserted in blank spaces on the map. The map could also be used as a tourist guidebook. The mountains and rivers outside the city are depicted in color and detailed explanations of famous places, such as Kiyomizudera (Kiyomizu Temple), are included along with pictorial depictions of the buildings. The size of the map would have made it awkward to carry around and the direction of the text varies, allowing it to be read from all sides. These factors suggest that it was intended to be spread out on the floor and viewed from any side.']",,,

The questionnaires covered such topics as demographics, political administration, languages spoken, physical terrain, and vegetation. The crown received 191 responses to these questionnaires. Of the 167 responses known to exist, 43 are in the Benson Latin American Collection. The others are held at the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, and the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The relaciones contain important historical, cultural, and geographical information about New Spain during the 16th century. Many of the questionnaires are accompanied by maps and pictures.

It depicts stations on the route, natural scenery, and famous places, such as Mount Fuji (in the 11th scene), accompanied by explanatory text. The second volume shows the route from Osaka to Nagasaki. It depicts mainly sea routes, although some land route scenes also appear after Kyūshū. Seto Naikai (The Inland Sea) stretches out in the middle of the pictures, and towns and scenic spots along the Honshū and Shikoku coasts are also depicted. This volume does not feature the sort of explanatory text that was provided in the first volume, but it does display the distances of the sea routes.

Each of 21 countries is represented as an animal, with the names of the countries identified by a key in the upper-left corner of the map.

Great Britain, a leopard, and France, a lion, both are trying to engage the tiger. Serbia appears to be a rat, gnawing of the ear of the Austro-Hungarian wolf. Ottoman Turkey is portrayed as a particularly unattractive crocodile, while the smaller countries, many of them neutral, are represented by smaller and more pacific animals, such as the Albanian rabbit and the Greek turtle.
